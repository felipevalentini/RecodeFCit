Data Big Five Forced-Choice - Clean
}
\description{
A data set containing 20 codes for forced-choice items set in 10 triplets (i.e., 3 items per block). The subject choices for each triplet were code in two columns, one for the least characteristic (-), and one for the most characteristic (+).

Items factor structure (* means a negative keyed item):

Openness: *It1, it4, it7, i10, it13, *i16;

Conscientiousness: it2, *it5, it8, it19, *it22, it25;

Extroversion: it3, it11, *it14, *it20, it23, it28;

Amability: it6, *it12, it17, it21, *it26, it29;

Neuroticism: *it9, it15, it18, it24, it27, *it30;
